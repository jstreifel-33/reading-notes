Django is a Python-based web framework that can be used for many purposes:

* As a tool to craft elegant URLs and link them with views
* As a templating language, for designing views
* Creating forms that can render, validate data, and convert submissions to native Python types.
* Authenticating user accounts, groups, permissions, and cookie-based user sessions.
* Automatic metadata display and site management tools.
* Internationalization - easily translating your site for reading in different languages and regions.
* Security against multiple types of attacks.

Django is an open source Python-based web framework. Despite being around for about 16 years, it is still actively developed and updated.

### Who Manages Django?

Being open-source, Django still requires funding and operates operates as a Non-profit under the Django Software Foundation.

The DSF pays programmers to be Fellows, which involves triaging tickets, managing releases, and generally keeping Django on track.

The DSF also supports projects related to Django in places like Kickstarter, as well as conferences related to Django.

Despite all this the DSF has a very small budget, consisting of $200,000 in 2019

### DSF Organization

The DSF handles administrative tasks, but the technical team has a different structure.

Django, technical team consists of trusted volunteers who work alongside Django Fellows. They divide into teams who have authority over different areas of the Django Project.
