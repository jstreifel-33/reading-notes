## The Growth Mindset
Reference: [How you can benefit from a growth mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)

#### In your own words...
The idea of the **growth mindset** seems most easily defined by contrasting it with its opposite, the **fixed mindset.** Where a growth mindset looks to expand skill-sets, knowledge, and horizons, a fixed mindset believes that these things are already set. If a task is seen as too difficult a fixed mindset will conclude that the task is impossible, as it must be outside the scope of our abilities. A growth mindset, however, when presented with task of similar difficulty will see the task as a goal of sorts. A growth mindset is understanding that don't have to be bounds on an individual's capabilities.

Similarly, a person with a growth mindset will not see the abilities and accomplishments of others as a boundary upon themselves. Skills and knowledge don't have to be a zero sum game. When you make a breakthrough in a team, share your process in addition to your progress.

Having a growth mindset allows a person to walk into a situation oblivious and walk out with something new. Being clueless in something, while never *ideal*, should be treated a starting point for something greater, rather than a dead end or hole never to be climbed out of.

All of that being said, let's get into:

#### How can *I* maintain a growth mindset?
1. Wake up early, and eat a good breakfast.
   - This may sound silly, but one of the easiest ways for me to maintain drive is to have a routine. The biggest challenge of the day is starting, especially when a daunting task is waiting in the coming hours. I should start each day with the conscious decision get up and get started. Waking up early will also allow me to have an entire day ahead of me to be spent on class, projects, or personal improvement. Spare time is better used doing something rather than nothing!
2. Exercise discipline when working on a task, but don't be afraid to take a break and return from different angle
   - There is certianly something to be said for putting your nose to the dirt (or keyboard, in this instance) and grinding out a task until it is finished. To avoid burnout, though it's almost equally important to know when you need to put down a task for a moment. Taking a break doesn't have to mean completely disengaging from the task at hand. Go for a walk and reflect on the issue. Talk it out with someone around a virtual water-cooler. Use downtime productively
   - When the day is done, be done. This course will be remote, so there is no office to walk out of. Leaving work at work is important to prevent burnout, so be mindful of the difference between "taking a break" and "calling it a day."
3. Utilize the resources available to me!
   - This is essentially a start from zero, so there is a lot to learn. I need to remember that it's okay to not know something. Throughout this course I'll meet some really knowledgeable people. It's important to realize that their expertise likely took time, and is definitely something I can achieve with enough work. Ask questions, save bookmarks, **take notes**, and keep learning. Programming seems to have a pretty deep rabbithole, so this should be exciting.
   
It may cliche, but as Einstein once said:

>The important thing is to never stop questioning.
