# Markdown is pretty neat

Markdown is a Github language used for creating readme files, keeping notes, or creating pages (like this one). On the surface that may seem underwhelming but there are some really useful tools you can use in markdown. You can format text to be **bold**, *italicized*, or even ~~struck through~~!

If you want to show off your code in a page or note, you can use a code block like this:
```
**this is how you bold**
*this is how you italicize*
~~this is how you strike through!~~
```
Code blocks don't have to be limited to markdown. They preserve all characters and use monospacing, so you can use them for any language you want!

All of this can all be useful for adding flavor to your notes or pages, but when you need to organize something (maybe you have an outline to do) you can use **lists!**

A list is exactly what is sounds like:

My shopping list:
- eggs
- milk
- butter
- sugar

You can create nested lists, as well.

My detailed shopping list:
- eggs
  - half dozen
  -organic
- milk
  - whole fat
- butter
  - unsalted
- sugar
  -coarse
  -brown
 
These tools will get you started in Markdown, but there's still much more to see and learn! You can even create links that lead to other github pages or completely different websites.
